### Find remote control ID

Remarque: Ematronic remote controls always start with : 09 19 03 so the area that interests us starts from "Test message" : 09 19 03.

Spot : Id1 and Id2 and add the following hexadecimal : in my example Id1=1F and Id2=84. you must therefore locate them in the line, "Test message" and extract the Id3, here Id3=B9, Our remote control therefore has the ID â‡’ 1F84B9.

### Stop Debug Mode using the "Stop/Restart the daemon" button"
