### Search for remote control ID

Remarque: Ematronic remote controls always start with : 09 19 03 so the zone which interests us starts from "Test message" : 09 19 03.

Spot : Id1 and Id2 and add the following hexadecimal : in my example Id1 = 1F and Id2 = 84. you must therefore locate them in the line, "Test message" and extract Id3, here Id3 = B9, Our remote control therefore has as ID â‡’ 1F84B9.

### Stop Debug Mode by the button "Stop / Restart the daemon"
