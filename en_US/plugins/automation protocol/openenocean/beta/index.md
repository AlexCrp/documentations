## Plugin configuration

>
> In order to use the plugin, you must download, install and activate it like any Jeedom plugin.

> ****
>
> The most important thing here is to select your USB Controller (you can choose Auto it will work for the Enocean USB300 key). For any other model it is better to choose it from the list :

-    : 
-    : 
-    : ttyS1

The other option available on this page is : **Automatically delete excluded devices**. This removes Jeedom equipment when it is excluded.
