# Energy plugin

Plugin allowing to display a global graph of the energy of the house (water, gas, electricity, electricity production).

It also displays a dashboard that shows the performance of a solar panel system, the consumption (water, gas and electricity) as well as the details of the electricity consumption of certain equipment (necessary of course to have a module to measure it)

For those who have solar power, it can also show you the production forecast according to the characteristics of your installation (to be informed)

Please note that the plugin does not and will not calculate any cost (it is not its purpose and it will not be)

To work it requires that you have modules that upload this information : 

## Gaz

- Consumption day
- Instant consumption

## Eau

- Consumption day
- Instant consumption

## ElectricitÃ©

- Consumption day
- Instant consumption

If you have solar panels you need more : 

- Import of electricity from the networks
- Network electricity export
- Production day
- Net power
