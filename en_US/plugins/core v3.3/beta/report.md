# What is a report ?

A report is a screenshot of the Jeedom interface at an instant T (the capture is adapted so as not to take the menu bar and other unnecessary element on this type of use).

You can do this on views, design, panel page....

It is triggered from a script with the report command, you can choose to have this report sent to you using a message command (email, telegram....)

# Utilisation

Its use is very simple you select if you want to see :

-	view reports

- Equipment reports (for a summary of the battery of each module)

Then you select the name of the report in question then you will see all the dates of the reports in memory
