# How to report a bug ?

There are several ways in Jeedom to report a concern :

- Put the concern back on the [community](https://community.jeedom.com), this is usually where you will get the quickest response.
- Report a concern to the Jeedom team :
  - **Support request** (requires a service pack power or more or even if the concern is on a plugin / paid service), this request is **private** and will put you directly in contact with the Jeedom support team which analyzes your particular case.
  - **Bug report**, in this case the request is **public** and will be posted on the community.
  - **Request for improvement**, in this case the request is **public** and will be posted on the community.

> **NOTE**
>
> In the case of a support request on a third-party plugin, an email is sent to the plugin developer.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> The support being carried out exclusively by email, remember to monitor your spam. Most often, the support responds quickly (delay before response on average of less than 72 hours, be careful depending on the problem it can be much longer).

## What information to send to have a solution as quickly as possible ?

Whatever method is used to report the problem encountered, it is very important to give as much information as possible. Indeed, to our greatest regret, 80% of requests have the first standard response : "please give us more information about the problem so that we can help you. [...]". And yes ... despite our good will, we do not see your screen, we have no history of what you did as manipulation, and we sometimes use a different vocabulary to talk about the same things...

But as we really want to help you, here are some clues to give us some valuable information :

- Your concern concerns a graphical display problem (widget, page, text fields ...), even if it seems obvious to you during the explanation, put a screenshot (indeed, it is possible to copy the image directly on the community!), it takes 30s for you, it will save several tens of minutes for the person trying to help you, and you will get a relevant answer, faster.
- You have a "500" error or "\ {\ {" on Jeedom : in this case, directly put the http file.error (you can find it quickly in Analysis -> Logs), without that, we cannot know where the problem comes from (again, no warning light at jeedom or among third-party developers for the moment !^^)
- You have a javascript error (warning panel at the top right) or when you do F12 then console a red line. In this case, start by giving us the full error message in question. Unfortunately, in the majority of cases this error message being sometimes a little vague, does not by itself allow to identify the problem encountered. So you have to do F12 (in the browser, on the Jeedom tab where you are having trouble). Then click on "console", then try to reproduce the problem encountered (start by refreshing the page, and if necessary, repeat the same actions). You will normally get the error message again but this time you will have to click at the end of the line (it can be either as in the screenshot below or in the form VMXXX.js) :

Then take a screenshot of what will be displayed, in particular the red line :

![remonter_un_bug002](images/remonter_un_bug002.png)

Here if you follow all this well you should have answers to your problem much faster and much more accurate and maybe even allow the person who helped you to help another person faster.

- You have a problem with a demon ? it is absolutely necessary to put the log in debug of it otherwise no help will be possible. You can also add the dependencies installation log (often in\_update).
- You have a problem installing dependencies ? it is absolutely necessary to put the log of their installation (often in\_update).
