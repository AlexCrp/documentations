# Cloud service

The cloud service is a Jeedom service allowing you to extend the possibilities of your Jeedom easily and quickly. Its role is to serve as a gateway between your Jeedom and other service provider's cloud services.

To avoid any abuse, the service is subject to quotas depending on your type of service pack.
