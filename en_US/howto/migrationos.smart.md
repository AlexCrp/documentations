# Upgrade the Debian environment of a Smart

We will detail the procedure of **migration of the Debian environment of the Smart box** so that you can have an overview of the different steps before practice. Note that all the steps are also explained on the screen as the migration progresses.

## Prerequisites

The migration of the Debian environment and the Smart kernel is a long and complex process, several essential prerequisites must therefore be taken into account before starting the operation.

It is necessary in particular :

- power **stay on the migration page** during the whole process *(it takes about 1h30)*,
- to prepare [a USB key formatted in **FAT32**](https://fr.wikihow.com/formater-en-FAT32){:target = "\_ blank"} and having **more than 8GB of free space**,
- be on the **same local network** than the Smart box and access it from its **internal address**.

>**IMPORTANT**
>
>As usual, it is strongly recommended to keep a **recent backup** of your Jeedom beforehand.

## Migration

### Initiate migration

You have the possibility to initiate the migration procedure in 2 ways :

- Going to the menu **Settings → System → Image Restore** :

- By being invited to the **Update center** when necessary :

### Step 1

The first step in the migration is to prepare and verify the hardware. The previously mentioned prerequisites are recalled in a pop-up window and you are prompted to insert a USB key *(formatted in FAT32)* with more than 8GB of free space in the Smart box.

Once the USB stick is inserted, you can click on the arrow to start the process :

When the prerequisites are validated, we can go to step 2 :

>You don't have to stay in front of the screen during the whole process. This will take place automatically until you offer to restore a backup.

### Step 2

The second step will take care of generating a backup of your Jeedom, a copy of which will be kept on the USB key. This backup will be restored at the end of the migration process if you wish. If necessary, the backup is located in a directory named ``Backup`` on the USB stick.

We still recommend that you make sure you have a recent Jeedom backup available elsewhere.

The duration of the backup phase will depend on the size of your installation and the remote backup options implemented. You have the option to speed up the process by disabling the sending of Market and / or Samba backups beforehand.

### Step 3

The third step will allow you to download the image containing the new version of the Debian environment and check its validity after downloading :

This step may take a while and will depend on the speed of your internet connection as well as the read / write performance of the USB key :

### Step 4

By far the most important step because it is the actual migration of the hardware. Above all, do not disconnect the USB key or cut off the power supply to the Smart during this phase !

This step lasts about thirty minutes after which the Smart box will restart. This first reboot is likely to take some time :

### Finalization of the migration

At the end of the migration process, the Smart box is now in an up-to-date environment but with a virgin Jeedom. The finalization of the procedure will therefore consist either of starting from a clean installation or of restoring the backup generated during the first step :

>**Make sure to remove the USB key from the Smart box at the end of the operation.**

Congratulations, **your Smart box is now up to date and operational** !

## Frequently Asked Questions

>**The migration process takes place correctly, however no change seems to have taken place after restarting the box ?**    
>This means that the USB key used is not correctly recognized by the migration tool. Please repeat the operation with another USB key or [repartition your USB key](https://fr.wikihow.com/partitionner-une-cl%C3%A9-USB){:target = "\_ blank"} taking care of **create only one partition** *(Single partition)*.

>**I can no longer authenticate on Jeedom following the migration of the environment.**    
>Jeedom having been reinstalled following the Debian environment update, as long as you have not restored a backup or created a new user, the default credentials are ***admin / admin***.

>**My box is no longer reachable following the migration of the environment.**    
>Check the presence and the ip address of the Jeedom box from the interface of your router in case it has changed its ip address.

>**Some plugins no longer work following the migration.**    
>Make sure you have reinstalled dependencies for plugins that require them *(consult the plugin configuration page)*.
