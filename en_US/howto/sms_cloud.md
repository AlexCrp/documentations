# SMS/Cloud calls

## Description

It is a paid Jeedom SAS service that allows you to send SMS and make calls (with message read by a robot) from your Jeedom.

A simple example is : in case of triggering the alarm then I receive a call with a voice which indicates for example the zone where the alarm is triggered. You can do the same with an SMS.
