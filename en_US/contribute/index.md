# Contribute to the development of Jeedom

Contributions, whether on the Core or on the Documentation, are always welcome, and we do our best to process them quickly. A mistake in the documentation, a passage that could be clearer, a bug on the Core ? The contributions are there for that.

Pull Requests are not always accepted, but if not we try to explain why, so that a next PR will be. Jeedom is not supposed to do everything for everyone, some things are more conducive to plugins for example. Side effects of seemingly simple changes can also be important. This is why we can decide not to integrate certain requests, or to do it differently.

Before developing code on your side, we recommend discussing it on [Community](https://community.jeedom.com/), especially for new features. The other contributors and users will thus be able to better guide you, if necessary, on this orientation, or even warn if others are already working on it.

### Documentation

Jeedom's documentation is centralized on this site, by several mechanisms. Like the Core of Jeedom, the documentation is accessible on Github and Open-Source.
