# Management of plugin widgets

There are several possibilities to make custom widgets for plugins :

- the first with the toHtml function (instance method) which inherits from the eqLogic class
- by the template system (v4 only)

## ToHtml function

Thereupon, nothing special, the toHtml function must return the widget in html, you have an example [the](https://github.com/jeedom/plugin-weather/blob/beta/core/class/weather.class.php#L647)

The important thing is especially the 1st lines :

````
$replace = $this->preToHtml($_version);
if (!is_array($replace)) {
	return $replace;
}
````

The preToHtml function returns :

- a string if the widget is cached (if it is cached, it means that there have been no changes since the last generation so you might as well send it back immediately)
- a table with the main replaces, you have the list [here](https://github.com/jeedom/core/blob/alpha/core/class/eqLogic.class.php#L663)

## The template system

The widget template system in the code is actually exactly the same as the one on the Tools -> Widget page of jeedom.

Here is an example :

````
public static function templateWidget(){
	$return = array('info' => array('string' => array()));
	$return['info']['string']['state'] = array(
		'template' => 'tmplmultistate',
		'test' => array(
			array('operation' => '#value# == 2','state' => '<i class="icon maison-vacuum6"></i>'),
			array('operation' => '#value# == 3','state' => '<i class="fa fa-pause"></i>'),
			array('operation' => '#value# > 3 || #value# < 2','state' => '<i class="fa fa-home"></i>')
		)
	);
	return $return;
}
````

Here, we will create a new widget based on the "tmplmultistate" template (you have the list of templates [here](https://github.com/jeedom/core/tree/alpha/core/template/dashboard) it's those with tmpl in their name), for an info type command and under string type.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Each template is for a given type and subtype, so you have to check that the template you want to use exists for the type and subtype

Then, since it is a template with several states, you have to define the icons according to the state. It is done in the test part of the table.

Example : for the first test, we say if the value of the command is worth 2 then it will be necessary to replace the tag #\_state_# (in the html code of the template) by </i>

Another example based on another template could be :

````
public static function templateWidget(){
	$return = array('info' => array('string' => array()));
	$return['info']['binary']['toto'] = array(
		'template' => 'tmplicon',
		'replace' => array(
			'#_icon_on_#' => '<i class=\'icon_green icon jeedom-porte-ferme\'></i>',
			'#_icon_off_#' => '<i class=\'icon_red icon jeedom-porte-ouverte\'></i>'
			)
	);
	return $return;
}
````

Here, I create a toto widget based on the "tmplicon" template in info type and binary subtype. When it is 1 then the icon will be <i class='icon_green icon jeedom-porte-ferme'></i> and when it is 0, it will be </i>

>**TIPS**
>
> Small tip, you can instead of an icon put an image tag (pay attention to the path)

Then to use your widget :

````
$cmd->setTemplate('dashboard','neato::state');
$cmd->setTemplate('mobile','neato::state');
````

It is like for a normal widget except for the name of the widget which is in the form id_plugin::name_widget. For the 2nd example, it will be id_plugin::toto
