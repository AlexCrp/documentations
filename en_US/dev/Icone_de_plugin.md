**Plugins icon documentation**

In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, any plugin must have an icon.

This icon will be the one displayed for users, on the market and from the Jeedom interface.

You must produce a file in png format, 309 x 348 pixels.

The file name is structured like this: `<plugin-id> _icon.png`

It should be saved in the `/plugin-info/` folder

This file is required.

We thank you in advance for not using the same color code as the icons of official Jeedom plugins.

Since 2020, it is recommended to no longer put the name under the image (be careful to keep the same sizes of the model !)

Thank you for using this model (rounded edges, size, colored background, transparency around etc..):
