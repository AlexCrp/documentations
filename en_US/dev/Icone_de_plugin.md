**Documentation plugins icon**

In order to be published on the Jeedom Market, any plugin must have an icon.

This icon will be the one displayed for users, on the market and from the Jeedom interface.

You have to produce a file in png format, of 309 x 348 pixels.

The file name is structured as follows: <plugin-id>_icon.png

It must be saved in the / plugin-info / folder

This file is required.

Thank you in advance for not using the same color code as the icons of the official Jeedom plugins.

For 2020 it is now recommended to no longer put the name under the image (be careful to keep the same size of the model anyway !)

Please use this template (rounded bors, size, colored background, transparency around etc.):
