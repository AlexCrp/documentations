## Summary

The ZIP-PSM01 detector offers 3 different functions : opening detection, temperature sensor and light detector. It consists of two parts : a detector and a magnet. They are designed to be placed on a door or window with the magnet fixed on the opening part and the detector on the fixed part.

Opening the door or window will move the magnet away from the detector, which will trigger the detector which will send a Z-Wave alarm signal, if the system is armed (this signal can be operated by a siren or by a home automation box for example). The sensor can also be used for automatic lighting control, depending on the brightness level. For example, the sensor will send a signal to the Z-Wave switch to turn on the light when the door opens and the room is dark.

The detector will also raise the brightness and the temperature, i.e. in the event of a significant change, and each time the opening / closing is detected.

A Z-Wave controller (remote control, dongle…) is necessary in order to integrate this detector into your network if you already have an existing network.

## Fonctions

-   3 in 1 detector: Aperture, temperature, light
-   Adopts the recent Z-Wave 400series chip to support multi-channel operations and higher data throughput (9.6 / 40 / 100kbps)
-   Uses the Z-Wave 6.02 SDK
-   Optimized antenna range
-   Use for home automation or security applications
-   Button to include / exclude the detector

## Configuration

To configure the OpenZwave plugin and know how to put Jeedom in inclusion, refer to this [Documentation](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/plugins/automation%20protocol/openzwave/).

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> To put this module in inclusion mode, press the inclusion button 3 times, according to its paper documentation.

### Commandes

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be available.

![Commands](images/philio.pst02c/commandes.jpg)

Here is the list of commands :

-   Opening : it is the command which will raise an opening detection
-   Temperature : it is the command which makes it possible to raise the temperature
-   Brightness : it is the command which makes it possible to raise the brightness
-   Drums : it's the battery command

### Configuration of the module

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> During a first inclusion always wake up the module just after the inclusion.

Then if you want to configure the module according to your installation, you have to go through the "Configuration" button of Jeedom's OpenZwave plugin.

Parameter details :

-   2: sets the signal sent to the modules in association group 2
-   4: adjusts the brightness level from which the signal defined in parameter 2 will be sent to the modules associated with group 2
-   5: operating mode (refer to the manufacturer's documentation) Recommended value : 8
-   6: multi-sensor operating mode (refer to the manufacturer's documentation) Recommended value : 4
-   7: personalized operating mode of the multi-sensor (refer to the manufacturer's documentation) Recommended value : 20 (to have the functional opening)
-   9: allows to define after how long the OFF signal will be sent to the modules associated with group 2
-   10: allows you to define the duration between two battery reports (one unit = parameter 20)
-   11: used to define the duration between two automatic opening reports (one unit = parameter 20)
-   12: allows you to define the duration between two auto brightness reports (one unit = parameter 20) Recommended value : 3
-   13: allows to define the time between two auto temperature reports (one unit = parameter 20) Recommended value : 2
-   20: duration of an interval for parameters 10 to 13 Recommended value : 10
-   21: temperature variation value in ° F to trigger a report
-   22: value in% of brightness variation to trigger a report Recommended value : 10

### Groupes

This module has two association groups, only the first is essential.

## Wakeup

To wake up this module there is only one way :

-   release the tamper button and press it again

## Important note

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> You have to wake up the module : after its inclusion, after a change in configuration, after a change in wakeup, after a change in association groups
