## Summary

SwiidInter is the first cord switch in the Z-Wave home automation environment that is small and discreet enough to be comparable to an ordinary cord switch.

It can be used both manually like any ordinary cord switch and remotely via a Z-Wave controller.

The SwiidInter switch also offers two-way association possibilities. Thus, it can be activated automatically by another Z-Wave device on the same network, such as by triggering a presence detector. Conversely, with a short press or with a long press, it can control two separate groups of Z-Wave devices associated with it : for example all the other lights in the room where your SwiidInter switch is located.

The SwiidInter switch is installed exactly like an ordinary cord switch : it is therefore a simple and fast installation which does not require any specialized tool. It must then be configured to integrate into a Z-Wave "network", this network can be as simple as a single remote control which controls your SwiidInter switch remotely.

## Fonctions

-   Switch on cord usable both manually (short press) and by radio remote (Z-Wave)
-   Use as a replacement for a standard cord switch on a bedside, table, or desk lamp
-   ON / OFF function
-   Activation of a home automation scenario on long press (Z-Wave association)

-   Installs like an ordinary cord switch
-   Suitable for all types of lamp bulbs
