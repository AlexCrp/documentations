## Summary

 : opening detection, temperature sensor and brightness detector. It consists of two parts : a detector and a magnet. They are designed to be placed on a door or window with the magnet fixed on the part that opens and the detector on the fixed part.

Opening the door or window will move the magnet away from the detector, which will trigger the detector which will send a Z-Wave alarm signal, if the system is armed (this signal can be operated by a siren or by a home automation box for example). The sensor can also be used for automatic lighting control, depending on the light level. For example, the sensor will send a signal to the Z-Wave switch to turn on the light when the door opens and the room is dark.

The detector will also raise the brightness and the temperature, either in the event of a significant change, and each time the opening/closing is detected. .

## Fonctions

-   3 in 1 detector: Aperture, temperature, light
-   Optimized antenna range
-   
-   Button to include/exclude the detector
-   Autoprotection
-   Low battery indication
-   Small, discreet and aesthetic
-   Ease of use and installation

### Commandes

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be available.

![Orders](images/dlink.dchz110/commandes.jpg)

Here is the list of commands :

-   Opening : this is the command that will report an opening detection
-   Temperature : this is the command that allows you to raise the temperature
-   Brightness : this is the command that allows you to increase the brightness
-   Sabotage : this is the sabotage command (it is triggered in the event of tearing)
-   Battery : this is the battery command

### Module Setup
