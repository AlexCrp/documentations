-   3: Sets the time interval for sending the temperature to Jeedom (in seconds)
-   4: Allows you to set how much the temperature must vary for the module to send it to Jeedom (in steps of 0.1 10- → 0.1)
-   5: Allows you to set a cut off temperature above which the module will cut off the relay

### Groupes

This module has two association groups. If the first is essential, the second is active and is essential if a temperature sensor is connected.
