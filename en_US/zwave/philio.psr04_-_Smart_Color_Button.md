## Summary

This uniquely designed switch offers several functions. You can use it to turn on, off or dim the lighting, adjust the position of your shutters, set the temperature of the thermostat or use it as a timer.

Once included in your Z-Wave network, the Philio PSR04 switch will need to be paired with the device(s) you want to control. It can only work by direct association with peripherals, and cannot launch scenes created in your Z-Wave home automation controller.

Used as a dimmer, it has the same behavior as a traditional dimmer. Turn the knob to the right to increase the light, and to the left to decrease it.

In addition, you can easily move and position this switch in the place of your choice thanks to its magnetic support. Its waterproof design allows it to be installed in a place with high humidity such as a bathroom.

It uses the latest Z-Wave 500 series chip, providing a 50% increase in radio range and 250% faster communication speed compared to previous Z-Wave products, as well as lower power consumption. allowing greater autonomy.

### Commandes

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be available.

![Orders](images/philio.psr04/commandes.jpg)

Here is the list of commands :

-   State : this is the command that will raise the position of the button from 0 to 100%
-   Battery : this is the command that reports the battery status of the module

### Module configuration

> **Important**
>
> During a first inclusion always wake up the module right after the inclusion.

Then if you want to configure the module according to your installation, you have to go through the "Configuration" button of the Jeedom OpenZwave plugin.

You will arrive on this page (after clicking on the settings tab)

Parameter details :

-   1: defines the lowest bound (far left position)
-   2 : defines the upper limit (position completely to the right)
-   10 : battery recovery time interval
-   25 : allows you to define if the module sends its position automatically after rotation (1s delay) or if you have to press the button to validate the sending
-   26 : activates the sending of scene or not on pressing the central button (parameter not taken into account in Jeedom)

### Groupes

This module has two association groups, the first is the only essential. The second allows the position to be traced to Jeedom

## Good to know

### Specificities

To use this module as a remote control, proceed as follows :

-   Add the controller in group 2

Indeed this type of module is not made to interact directly with a box but directly with other modules. However, by adding Jeedom to group 2, this makes it possible to receive the position of the button and therefore to use it to control a scenario (adjust a volume for example)

## Wakeup

To wake up this module there is only one way to proceed :

-   put the module in the low position and press the button

## Important Note

> **Important**
>
> You have to wake up the module : after its inclusion, after a change of configuration, after a change of wakeup, after a change of association groups
