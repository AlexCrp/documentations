## Summary

This unique design switch offers several functions. You can use it to turn on, off or dim the lights, adjust the position of your shutters, adjust the thermostat temperature or use it as a timer.

Once included in your Z-Wave network, the Philio PSR04 switch must be associated with the device (s) you wish to control. It can only work by direct association with peripherals, and cannot launch scenes created in your Z-Wave home automation controller.

Used as a dimmer, it has the same behavior as a traditional dimmer. Turn the knob to the right to increase the light, and to the left to decrease it.

In addition, you can easily move and position this switch at the location of your choice thanks to its magnetic support. Its waterproof design allows it to be installed in a place with high humidity such as a bathroom.

It uses the latest Z-Wave 500 series chip, offering a 50% increase in radio range and 250% faster communication speed compared to previous Z-Wave products, as well as lower power consumption allowing greater autonomy.

### Commandes

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be available.

![Commands](images/philio.psr04/commandes.jpg)

Here is the list of commands :

-   State : it is the command which will raise the position of the button from 0 to 100%
-   Drums : it is the command which reports the battery status of the module

### Configuration of the module

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> During a first inclusion always wake up the module just after the inclusion.

Then if you want to configure the module according to your installation, you have to go through the "Configuration" button of Jeedom's OpenZwave plugin.

![Setup plugin Zwave](images/plugin/bouton_configuration.jpg)

You will arrive on this page (after clicking on the parameters tab)

Parameter details :

-   1: defines the lowest bound (position completely left)
-   2 : defines the highest terminal (position completely right)
-   10 : battery ascent time interval
-   25 : allows to define if the module sends its position automatically after rotation (1s delay) or if it is necessary to press the button to validate the sending
-   26 : activates the sending of scene or not on pressing of the central button (parameter not taken into account in Jeedom)

### Groupes

This module has two association groups, the first is the only essential. The second allows to go up the position to Jeedom

## Good to know

### Specificities

To use this module as a remote control, proceed as follows :

-   Add the controller in group 2

Indeed this type of module is not made to interact directly with a box but directly with other modules. However by adding Jeedom to group 2, this allows you to receive the position of the button and therefore use it to control a scenario (adjust a volume for example)

## Wakeup

To wake up this module there is only one way :

-   put the module in the low position and press the button

## Important note

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> You have to wake up the module : after its inclusion, after a change in configuration, after a change in wakeup, after a change in association groups
