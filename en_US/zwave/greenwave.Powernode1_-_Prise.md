## Summary

GreenWave's PowerNode plug module is a smart device that connects to one of your home appliances and electronics to allow you to monitor and control power consumption remotely via a web browser or smartphone.

Using Z-Wave technology, the PowerNode controlled socket is compatible with most home automation boxes on the market such as Fibaro Home Center 2, eedomus or Zipabox.

The PowerNode socket module collects data on the energy consumption of the connected device and transmits it to the home automation box. This controlled outlet also allows you to activate or deactivate the device remotely via a web browser or smartphone or to define a calendar to automatically activate or deactivate your device at predefined times.

A small wheel on the side of the socket allows you to choose a color that will represent the room to which it is assigned. For example "blue for the bedroom ". This tip will allow you to differentiate your different PowerNode sockets and multiple sockets. You can also set this dial on a padlock. This function allows you to lock the plug to avoid accidentally turning it off, but control from home automation boxing will no longer be possible.

The PowerNode controlled socket also has a light status indicator which gives different information depending on its color : sockets on or off, limited radio range, inclusion and exclusion mode.

PowerNode plug module is equipped with overcurrent protection to protect the connected device. The PowerNode plug will be deactivated in the event of a faulty device or a short circuit. Additional protection is provided by the internal fuse located in the socket.
