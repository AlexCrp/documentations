## Summary

 : . It consists of two parts : a detector and a magnet. They are designed to be placed on a door or window with the magnet fixed on the part that opens and the detector on the fixed part.

Opening the door or window will move the magnet away from the detector, which will trigger the detector which will send a Z-Wave alarm signal, if the system is armed (this signal can be operated by a siren or by a home automation box for example). . . .

. .

. A Z-Wave controller (remote control, dongle, etc.) is required to integrate this detector into your network if you already have an existing network.
