Summary 
------

The FGD-212 dimmer module will allow you to control a
lamp or ceiling lamp remotely thanks to the Z-Wave protocol while
keeping your existing switch.

You will therefore be able to activate the connected lamp and vary its
intensity using the existing switch, a Z-Wave transmitter or
directly from the button on the micromodule.

The new Fibaro FGD-212 drive is equipped with an
intelligent light source detection which facilitates
configuration and ensures high compatibility of the device. he
has self-protection against overload and the function of
soft start. In the case of non-dimmable light sources,
only the ON / OFF function is possible (in 3-wire connection).

It is compatible with all types of lamps supporting variation or
no. In addition to the variation function, this micromodule can also
measure the electrical consumption of the connected load. Values
instantaneous consumption (in W) and total electrical consumption
(in kWh) can be viewed.
