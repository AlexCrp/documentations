## Summary

With smooth lines, a polished surface and a small size, this smoke detector will allow you to be alerted of a threat with multicolored RGB LEDs and an integrated siren. The large format of the grid makes it possible to detect the smallest amount of smoke in order to obtain a rapid reaction. It will very easily find its place in your home to preserve the safety of the whole family.

The Fibaro FGSD-002 smoke detector is an Autonomous Smoke Alarm Detector (DAAF) conforming to standard EN 14604:2005. Although autonomous, it is also communicative thanks to Z-Wave Plus technology.

Some materials burn without smoking. This is why Fibaro engineers decided to include additional protection in their smoke detector in the form of a temperature sensor. If the amount of smoke is not sufficient to trigger the alarm, the device will still be able to detect a threat by detecting a rapid change in temperature caused by the fire. A quick change in temperature or increase to 54 ° C is enough for the smoke sensor to detect a threat and report it to the inhabitants of the house. Only this type of smoke sensor offers high efficiency, regardless of what burns.

## Configuration

To configure the OpenZwave plugin and know how to put Jeedom in inclusion, refer to this [Documentation](https://doc.jeedom.com/en_US/plugins/automation%20protocol/openzwave/).

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> To put this module in inclusion mode, press the central inclusion button 3 times, according to its paper documentation.

### Commandes

Once the module is recognized, the commands associated with the module will be available.

![Commands](images/fibaro.fgsd102/commandes.jpg)

Here is the list of commands :

-   Smoke : it is the module alert command (for smoke, heat)
-   Temperature : it is the temperature measurement command
-   Sabotage : this is the sabotage command. It signals the opening of the case
-   Test alert : it is the command which will bring up the fact that the module is in test mode
-   Heat alert : it is the control which will raise a heat alert (not reliable yet)
-   Drums : it's the battery command

### Configuration of the module

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> During a first inclusion always wake up the module just after the inclusion.

Then it is necessary to configure the module according to your installation. To do this, go through the "Configuration" button of Jeedom's OpenZwave plugin.
