## Summary

Control your security system with this mini Zipato wall keypad !

With this Z-Wave compatible RFID keypad, you will be able to easily activate or deactivate your alarm system. The "Home" and "Away" keys allow you to arm / disarm the security system and / or execute home automation scenarios quickly. In addition to using the numeric keypad, you can also pass an RFID badge in front of the keyboard to arm / disarm the system. The keyboard transmits to your home automation controller the identifier of the badge that has been recognized. You can thus easily create scenarios according to the person who used his badge.

-   To register a new code click on the green button on the desired memory and follow the steps
-   To delete a code just click on the red button.
-   It is impossible to save the same code / badge on two different memories
-   It is impossible (for security reasons) to read the value of a registered code

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Remember to wake up the module after adding a code or badge.

## Examples of use

![exemple](images/zipato.minikeypad/exemple.jpg)

The trigger is the event command, in fact it is only updated when a valid code / badge has been presented. If the value is 6 (home) we deactivate the alarm (for example), or turn on the power strip, we turn on the light depending on the brightness, we send a notification to signal that someone has returned, we launch a synhtesis voice to do a weather report for example. Otherwise (necessarily 5) we activate the alarm, we cut the power strip, we send a notification to signal that the house is empty.

## Good to know

### Specificities

The keypad reads codes / badges in two ways :

-   when you press home / away for the first 1 to 2 seconds if you start typing a code, it will read that code
-   if nothing is done within the first 1 to 2 seconds, it goes into RFID badge reading mode (red light on). At that time he can read a badge, not before.

## Wakeup

To wake up this module there are two ways to proceed :

-   press the tamper button then release after 1 to 2 seconds
-   press Home, a random number and Enter

## Important note

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> You have to wake up the module : after its inclusion, after a change in configuration, after a change in wake up, after a change in association groups
