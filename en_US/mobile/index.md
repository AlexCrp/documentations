# Mobile version

Jeedom can be used on Mobile in two ways.

## WebApp

Jeedom adopts a specific version on mobile and tablet. You access it from the same address, in a mobile browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.).

This adapted version is also simplified, for the sake of display and performance.
